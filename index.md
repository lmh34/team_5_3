[Machine Learning at Scale: Flight Delay Prediction](/flight_delay_prediction)
<br>
<br>
Can flight delays be predicted in advance of their scheduled departure times? This Machine Learning at Scale project used Spark, Databricks, and 5 years of U.S. flight and weather data to predict flight delays of at least 15 minutes at 2 hours in advance of scheduled departure.
